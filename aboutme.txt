Glad you could make it! Since you are here, let me tell you a little about myself. I am a graduating senior with a strong background in fields ranging from Physics, Mathematics, and Computer Science to Biology, Chemistry, and Health Science. This wide array of skills highlights my diverse background and open mindset. As a student, I gravitate towards challenging and thought-provoking problems in differential equations and the physical sciences. The ability to characterize reality with little more than a pencil and paper is almost unbelievable. I am fascinated by the foundational laws governing our natural world, and the abundance of elegance present at both the smallest and largest of scales.
